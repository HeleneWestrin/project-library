# Sweden's National Parks

## The project

The aim was to create some sort of library that could be filtered in some way and also sorted. I decided to create a library over the National Parks in Sweden.

## The problem

The biggest challange was to figure out how to combine both the filter and the sorting so that they worked together.

If I would have had more time I would have wanted to try adding a range slider with two values for filtering on size.
